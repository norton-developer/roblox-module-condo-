# Documentation for Roblox Module Condo

## Overview

The Roblox Module Condo is designed to facilitate account management, including user login and registration functionalities. This module is built with asynchronous programming in mind, allowing for efficient multitasking operations.

## Installation

To use the module, ensure you have Python installed and then include the module file in your project directory.

## Class and Functions

The main class in this module provides two key functions for user authentication:

### Login with Error Checking

This function logs in a user while checking for errors and managing the login time. It can be called as follows:

```python
status_code = await module.login(username="user", password="password")
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `username`: The user's username (string).
  - `password`: The user's password (string).
- **Returns**: A status code indicating the result of the login attempt.

### Quick Login

This function allows for a faster login without error checks:

```python
status = await module.login(username="user", password="password")
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `username`: The user's username (string).
  - `password`: The user's password (string).
- **Returns**: A status indicating success or failure of the login attempt.

## Asynchronous Operations

Both functions are designed to be used with Python's `asyncio` library, enabling them to operate without blocking other tasks. This is particularly useful in applications where multiple operations may need to occur simultaneously, such as handling multiple user requests or background processes.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the module for logging in:

```python
import asyncio
from module import RobloxModule  

async def main():
    username = "your_username"
    password = "your_password"
    
    # Login with error checking
    status_code = await module.login(username=username, password=password)
    print(f"Login Status Code: {status_code}")

    # Quick login
    status = await module.login(username=username, password=password)
    print(f"Quick Login Status: {status}")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a concise overview of the Roblox Module Condo, focusing on its asynchronous login functionalities. For further customization or advanced features, users are encouraged to explore additional methods within the module.
